## About Apache StreamPipes

Apache StreamPipes (incubating) enables flexible modeling of stream processing pipelines by providing a graphical
 modeling
 editor on top of existing stream processing frameworks.

It leverages non-technical users to quickly define and execute processing pipelines based on an easily extensible 
toolbox of data sources, data processors and data sinks. StreamPipes has an exchangeable runtime execution layer and executes pipelines using one of the provided wrappers, e.g., for Apache Flink or Apache Kafka Streams.

Pipeline elements in StreamPipes can be installed at runtime - the built-in SDK allows to easily implement new 
pipeline elements according to your needs. Pipeline elements are standalone microservices that can run anywhere - centrally on your server, in a large-scale cluster or close at the edge.

## Use Cases

StreamPipes allows you to connect IoT data sources using the SDK or the built-in graphical tool StreamPipes 
Connect.

The extensible toolbox of data processors and sinks supports use cases such as
* Continuously **store** IoT data streams to third party systems (e.g., databases)
* **Filter** measurements on streams (e.g., based on thresholds or value ranges)
* **Harmonize** data by using data processors for transformations (e.g., by converting measurement units and data types
 or by aggregating measurements)
* **Detect situations** that should be avoided (e.g., patterns based on time windows)
* Wrap **Machine Learning models** into data processors to perform classifications or predictions on sensor and image data
* **Visualize** real-time data from sensors and machines using the built-in Live Dashboard


## Installation

The quickest way to run StreamPipes is the Docker-based installer script available for Unix, Mac and Windows (10).

It's easy to get started:
1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
2. Clone or download the installer script from [https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-installer](https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-installer)
3. Execute ``./streampipes start`` 
4. Enter the hostname and choose the version you'd like to run (the Lite version runs with less memory assigned to Docker (< 6 GB), use the full version if you have more memory available)
5. Open your browser, navigate to ``http://YOUR_HOSTNAME_HERE`` and follow the installation instructions.
6. Once finished, switch to the pipeline editor and start the interactive tour or check the [online tour](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/user-guide-tour/) to learn how to create your first pipeline!

For a more in-depth manual, read the installation guide at [https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/user-guide-installation/](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/user-guide-installation/)!

## Pipeline Elements

StreamPipes includes a repository of ready-to-use pipeline elements. A description of the standard elements can be 
found in the Github repository [streampipes-extensions](https://www.github.com/apache/incubator-streampipes-extensions).

## Building StreamPipes

To properly build the StreamPipes core, the following tools should be installed:

### Prerequisites
* Java 8 JDK (minimum)
* Maven (tested with 3.6)
* NodeJS + NPM (tested with v12+/ v6+)
* Docker + Docker-Compose

### Building

To build the core project, do the following:

```
    mvn clean package
```

To build the ui, switch to the ``ui`` folder and perform the following steps:

```
    npm install
    npm run build
```

### Starting

To start StreamPipes, run ``docker-compose up -d`` from the root directory.

You can also use the installer or CLI as described in the ``Installation`` section.

## Extending StreamPipes

You can easily add your own data streams, processors or sinks. A [Java-based SDK](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/dev-guide-tutorial-processors) and several [run-time wrappers](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/dev-guide-architecture) for popular streaming frameworks such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark and Apache 
Kafka Streams (and also plain Java programs) can be used to integrate your existing processing logic into StreamPipes. Pipeline elements are packaged as Docker images and can be installed at runtime, whenever your requirements change.

Check our developer guide at [https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/dev-guide-introduction](https://streampipes.apache.org/docs/docs/dev-guide-introduction).
